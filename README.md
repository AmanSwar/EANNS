# **EANNS – Enhanced Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search**  

EANNS is a **high-performance, hybrid vector database** designed for **real-time, scalable, and metadata-aware vector search**. Unlike traditional ANN solutions like FAISS, Milvus, or Weaviate, EANNS is optimized for **both speed and persistence**, leveraging **RAM for ultra-fast queries** and **disk storage for long-term scalability**.  

#### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Hybrid Storage** → RAM (fast retrieval) + Disk (persistent storage)  
✅ **Hybrid Search** → Combines vector similarity search with structured metadata filtering  
✅ **Real-Time Updates** → No need for full reindexing like FAISS; supports dynamic indexing  
✅ **Optimized with CUDA & OpenMP** → Extreme speed via parallel computing  
✅ **Redis-Style Simplicity** → Minimal setup, easy-to-use API, open-source scalability  

Built in **C++ with CUDA and OpenMP**, EANNS is designed for **high-performance AI, search, and recommendation systems**, offering **unmatched efficiency and flexibility** compared to existing vector search solutions. 🚀

### 🔥 **Current Status: Under Development**  
EANNS is in **active development**, with key components being implemented iteratively. The first release will focus on:  
 **Core vector storage** (RAM/Disk hybrid)  
 **Brute-force search (Flat Index)**  
 **Efficient indexing with SIMD & parallelism**  
 **IVF, HNSW, and PQ-based search (WIP)**  
 **Real-time indexing & metadata filtering (WIP)**  
 **CUDA-accelerated ANN search (Coming soon)**

## ⚡ **Key Features (Planned)**  
### **1. Flexible Storage & Search**  
- **Multiple Index Types**:  
  - **SpaceFlat** → Brute-force search (like IndexFlatL2).  
  - **SpaceCluster** → Cluster-based search (like IndexIVF).  
  - **SpaceGraph** → Graph-based search (like IndexHNSW).  
  - **SpaceQuantize** → Compressed search (like IndexPQ).  
- **Hybrid Storage**: RAM (fast access) & Disk (persistent storage).  

### **2. Optimized for Speed & Scale**  
- **CUDA-accelerated search** (for GPU compute).  
- **OpenMP for multi-threaded query execution**.  
- **SIMD-powered vectorized computations**.  

### **3. Metadata-Aware Hybrid Search**  
- **Supports metadata filtering alongside vector similarity**.  
- **Key-value store for fast lookup & hybrid queries**.
